# Basic REST-API



## Description

This project is a simple REST API developed with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It is designed to manage educational course data, supporting CRUD operationsâ€”Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT), and Delete (DELETE). Course resources are stored locally in the "db.json" file, without using an external database.

Data validation is performed through Zod, ensuring that only correct data is processed by the API. To maintain high standards of quality and reliability, the project is equipped with a suite of automated tests. These tests, provided by our teacher, verify that each endpoint operates as expected, conforming to the typical behaviors associated with CRUD operations.
